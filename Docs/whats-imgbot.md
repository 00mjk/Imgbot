Images are one of the key parts of almost any website or application, but they also play a really big role in performance degradation. The more images you have, the slower your load times can become.

There are a lot of tactics for updating your images to be more performant like cropping and resizing, but running a lossless compression is something you should always do to optimize the delivery without sacrificing size or quality.

ImgBot does just that and takes the heavy lifting out for you. With just a couple of clicks you can get ImgBot running in your project's repo on GitHub and sending you pull requests with your images optimized.

As you continue making further optimizations to the design and delivery of your application, ImgBot will be there optimizing your images for you the whole time.
